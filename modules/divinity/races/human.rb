  description "Most humans are the descendants of pioneers, conquerors, traders, travelers, refugees, and other people " +
          "on the move. As a result, human lands are home to a mix of people--physically, culturally, religiously, and " +
          "politically different. Hardy or fine, light-skinned or dark, showy or austere, primitive or civilized, "+
          "devout or impous, humans run the gamut.\n\n"+
          "Personality: Humans are the most adaptable, flexible, and ambitious people among the common races. They are "+
          "diverse in their tastes, morals, customs, and habits. Others accuse them of having little respect for history, "+
          "but it's only natural that humans, with their relatively short lifespans and constantly changing cultures, "+
          "would have a shorter collective memory than dwarves, elves, gnomes, or halflings."
