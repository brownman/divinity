Figured I'd better start making a list of to-do items somewhere. Comments in source code only go so far.

* Implement :mouse_entered, :mouse_exited and :mouse_over interface events.

* Implement keyboard events of all flavors, namely :key_pressed, :key_released, :key_typed

* Streamline height map loading. Right now it has to be manually loaded from the engine itself; they need to be
  triggered by controller actions and the maps themselves loaded from modules. This includes the Scene that makes use
  of the height map, which would also be in charge of figuring out texturing, bump maps and whatnot.

* Implement multitexturing. The first test of this will be with the height maps. It's not as hard as it sounds.

* Implement bump mapping. Also not as hard as it sounds.

* Implement a particle generator. I've written about half a dozen of them, so I know how to do it, but this one needs
  to be fairly advanced so that it can be used for anything from torches to spells extremely easily. These also need
  to be configurable and triggered from modules.

* Come up with a character editor similar to Oblivion's. I'm eyeing MakeHuman for this, though I don't know much about
  it yet. If it works out, it'll save me a whole lot of time.

* Streamline the installation process. I think we're far enough along at this point to make it easy to install Divinity.

* Come up with object models: arrows, weapons, armor, clothing, etc.

* Make these models available in-game via modules.
