Interfaces have evolved a lot, and are still evolving.

I'm seriously considering (as in, virtually decided and just not had time to do so yet) turning the whole interface into
a Rails-style MVC structure. We already have models in place; the only thing left is to separate view from controller.
Wouldn't be that hard to do.

NOTE TO SELF: Actually do it!

While I'm at it: Should the views be simple HTML templates? Hmmmm. Probably not, because it'd be quite difficult to link
HTML elements to action handlers.

Also, I want to add subdirectories for organizational purposes. How to do this intuitively? Rails has yet to do it well.
