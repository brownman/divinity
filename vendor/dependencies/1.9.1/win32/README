All of the dependencies in this dir install; unfortunately, RMagick is missing. I can't get it to install on my box. Even the one that claims to be built for Ruby 1.9.1 pukes at the postinstall, asking for Ruby 1.8 libraries. If anyone figures it out, drop me a line. Until then, I'm waiting for something more solid to be compiled and posted on rmagick.rubyforge.org. That said, I'm grudgingly going back to Ruby 1.8. I'm leaving the 1.9 deps attached as a reminder to myself, mostly, of what is required -- and this file is my reminder to self that RMagick was the reason I never upgraded. Doubt I'll need a reminder of that.
