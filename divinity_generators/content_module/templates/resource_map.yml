# This file is used to map your resources to the objects they represent.
#
# You don't need to use this file unless you have a nonstandard folder layout.
# For instance, you could call the "actors" folder "characters" instead, and then
# your map file would contain:
#
#   characters: Actor
#
# Divinity is smart enough to create a "characters" method within the engine,
# as well, so you can reference engine.characters(:player) within the engine just like
# you can reference engine.actors(:player) by default.
#
characters: Actor
